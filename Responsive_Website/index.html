                My name is Jeffrey Neal Crump.  I grew up in a small farming town called Turkey, Texas.  I am the middle child.  I have an older sister and a younger brother.
                My high school was small.  I had 27 people in my graduating class.  I grew up wanting to be a professional football player.  I played football in high school
                but I blew out my knee when I was a senior.  That was the end of my dreams of playing football at the professional level.  I have been working in Information
                Technology for more than 20 years.  When I started you made data requests on a dumb terminal and the request was processed by a mainframe.  I was there when
                server technology was introduced and businesses started migrating to client-server architecture.  I have also witness the return of the terminal-mainframe 
                architecture with the popularity of cell phones and small portable devices.
