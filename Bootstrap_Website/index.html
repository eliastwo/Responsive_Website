						My name is Jeffrey Neal Crump.  I grew up in Turkey, Texas which in located in the Texas Panhandle.  I am the middle child.  I have an older sister and a younger brother.  I grew up wanting to be a professional football player.  I played football in high school but I blew out my knee when I was a senior and that was the end of my football career.  I have been working in Information Technology (IT) for more than 20 years.  I started working in IT when you had a dumb terminal and you made data requests to a mainframe.  I saw the advent of the client-server architecture and the introduction of server technology.  I have also witnessed a return to the dumb terminal-mainframe architecture with the explosion of cell phones and small portable devices. I am taking this coding boot camp because I want to work as a developer.  I want to create code and services and websites that customers can use for business, social media, or pleasure.
					</p>
					<p>I am hoping this class will provide me the opportunity to become a front-end developer.  I hope the experience I gain from this boot camp will allow me to build websites, work as a javascript developer, or work as a beck-end developer.</p>
